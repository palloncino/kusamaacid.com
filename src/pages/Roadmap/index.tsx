        Kusama Kingdom is an NFT project that started with the Kusama Kings collection in October of 2021 on Singular (built on Kusama). From the outset the goal was to create a project that focused on community and not just profits. We are aiming to build something special not just through the NFTs having value but also through our Discord and ‘The Great Hall’ - a private area for Kusama King or Queen holders to discuss the wider ecosystem, other NFT projects, crowdloans and anything else they like while taking in some cold ales!
        To highlight our commitment to the community we have given away some of the rarest and most desirable Kusama Kingdom NFTs, and have continued to add utility as the project progressed through KingPad (Giving holders access to seed and private rounds of projects) and ‘The Kings Bounty’ an investment fund set up and collectively managed by Kings which pays a risk free yield to all holders. By involving the community in the sourcing and analysing of deals we believe we are on a path to create a decentralised investment fund that goes beyond what we have seen from an NFT project.
        We are passionate about the Kusama ecosystem as a whole and this is our gift to the community, we hope people enjoy it
